# computer-graphics-final-image-competition

Two scenes were created building off of the ray tracing assignment and raster images assignment. The scenes were combined into one GIF (image.gif in this repository) created using GIMP. The theme of the scene is a a shooting of a tourist advertisement for the city of Seattle. The various STL models were positioned in the scenes using Blender. The models were chosen to be references to things that the city of Seattle is known for. Amazon (and Danbo, the unofficial Amazon mascot) represents the city's tech industry. The Space Needle is iconic in the city's skyline. A cup of Starbucks coffee as one of Seattle's well-known exports.

The first component scene is an imagining of a filming set, with spot lights, and director's chair/camera. Planes on the floor of the scene and the wall behind the models represent film green screens.

## textured_seattle.ppm
The second component scene is an imagining of post-production adding backgrounds onto the green screens. This is done by mapping textures onto the green screen planes. The wall background is an image of Seattle's skyline including Mt. Rainier. The floor background is a wood texture meant to represent a stage.
